<h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Osmar Junior! </h1>

Currently totaling 11 years of bilingual professional experience in the field of information technology. Along this path, I built extensive knowledge in network infrastructure with a focus on monitoring, advanced support, troubleshooting, design, implementation and employee training. I have knowledge of programming languages â€‹â€‹such as Python, JavaScript and SQL.
Leadership, communication, negotiation and budget control skills, adaptation to new roles and professional environments are differentiators that I bring with me to this journey.
